/*
 -Abstract class:
 -An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword
 
 -Abstract is a process of hiding the implementation details
 and showing only functionality{function declarations} to the user.
 -Can not make object of abstract class directly, but through derived class{cannot be instantiated}
 
 -Examples of abstract method?
 	-Abstract class may contain abstract and non abstract methods
 	-(0-100%) abstract methods can be there!
 	
 	-In case of Interference: 100% abstract methods should be there!
 	
 	-Final class-
 	-The main purpose of using a class being declared as final class is to prevent the class from being inherited
 	-If a class is marked as final class then no class can inherit any feature from final class.
 	-One cannot extend final class if one try to do then it will show compile time error.
